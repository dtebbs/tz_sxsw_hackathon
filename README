Extra tools and code for Turbulenz.

build.py
~~~~~~~~

(Must be run from within the Turbulenz SDK env)

Run from a game project root.  The tool will create a mapping table
and build all assets contained in the 'assets' directory.  It will
also build the .html and JS code for each .js file in the 'templates'
directoy (each .js file may optionally have an associated .html file).
